# examples

Some examples of uniform random trees in adjacency matrix format. `wolfville.txt` is a reproduction of Dr. Addario-Berry's example from MSCS 2024, while `main22.txt` and `main1000.txt` are randomly generated trees on 22 and 1000 nodes, respectively. `main22.png` is a rendering of the `main22` tree plotted using SageMath in Python.
