`metric_240K_600.txt` is a normalized random distance matrix with `n = 240,000` and `k = 600`. Additionally, some examples of uniform random trees in adjacency matrix format: `wolfville.txt` is a reproduction of Dr. Addario-Berry's example from MSCS 2024, while `main22.txt` and `main1000.txt` are randomly generated trees on 22 and 1000 nodes, respectively.
