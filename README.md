# uniform-tree-random-metric-spaces

An algorithm to generate large uniform trees using Prüfer codes to simulate random metric spaces, written in Java. Can currently produce uniform trees of order `n ≤ 240,000` and generate normalized distance matrices from `k ≤ 600` random nodes in less than four minutes. This project was inspired by Dr. Louigi Addario-Berry's `Random graphs and random trees` plenary talk at the Science Atlantic MSCS Conference 2024 in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. __(NOTE: Still in progress.)__
