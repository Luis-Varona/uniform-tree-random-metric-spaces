# uniform-tree-random-metric-spaces

An algorithm to generate large uniform trees using Prüfer codes to simulate random metric spaces, written in Java. Can currently produce random trees on up to `n ≤ 2500` nodes in less than a minute. This project was inspired by Dr. Louigi Addario-Berry's `Random graphs and random trees` plenary talk at the Science Atlantic MSCS Conference 2024 in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. __(NOTE: The functionality to convert uniform trees into metric spaces is still in progress.)__
